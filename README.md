# AI-Powered-Multi-Factor-Attendance-System-QR-Facial-Recognition-IP-Self-Verification
This next-gen AI-driven attendance system integrates QR code scanning, AI-powered facial recognition, and IP self-verification to ensure secure, foolproof, and automated attendance tracking. Designed for universities, corporate offices, and secure access systems, this system eliminates proxy attendance by enforcing multi-factor authentication.

🛠 Key Features:
✅ QR Code-Based Seat Assignment – Teachers generate unique QR codes for each student’s assigned seat, ensuring an authorized check-in process.
✅ AI-Powered Facial Recognition – The system captures live images, verifies them against stored embeddings, and authenticates student identity.
✅ IP Self-Verification – The system enforces geolocation validation, allowing students to self-verify their authorized IP addresses to prevent remote check-ins.
✅ Time-Limited Authentication – Attendance windows expire after 5 minutes, ensuring students authenticate in real-time.
✅ Secure Cloud-Based Storage – Attendance records and validation logs are securely stored in Supabase, ensuring data integrity and accessibility.
✅ CSV-Based Class & Seating Management – Teachers can bulk upload class schedules and seating arrangements for easy management.
✅ Modern & Responsive UI – A sleek, professional, and intuitive interface designed for seamless student and teacher interaction.

🔍 How It Works:
1️⃣ Student scans the assigned QR Code ➝ System verifies seat assignment.
2️⃣ IP Validation in Progress ➝ Confirms student's network matches the authorized location.
3️⃣ Location & Time Validation ➝ Ensures attendance is being marked within a valid timeframe.
4️⃣ Live Face Capture & AI Authentication ➝ Uses Keras-FaceNet to match the student’s real-time face with registered data.
5️⃣ Attendance Verified! ✅ ➝ Student’s attendance is logged securely, preventing spoofing or proxy attendance.
